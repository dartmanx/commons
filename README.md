# Jason's Commons

This is my repository for common reusable code.

## Java and Javascript

These are old. I would likely use third-party utilities for most of this these days, especially in the Javascript where I would use lodash.

## React Native

This is where I keep stuff I would reuse between projects. I'm especially proud of the DbUtil.js for managing SQLite databases, hopefully it will help someone else out there.
